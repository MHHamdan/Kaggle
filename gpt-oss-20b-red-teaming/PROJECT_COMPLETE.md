## 🎯 Finding Summary

### The Vulnerability
The GPT-OSS-20B model demonstrates **systematic overconfidence** in responses to questions where uncertainty would be more appropriate. This represents a form of **reward hacking** where the model optimizes for perceived helpfulness over accuracy.

### Key Evidence
- **Overconfidence Rate**: 87.5% (14/16 test responses)
- **High Confidence Rate**: 56.3% (9/16 responses scored 7-10)
- **Average Confidence Score**: 6.8/10 in uncertain domains
- **Pattern**: Consistent across financial, medical, personal, and future prediction domains

### Vulnerability Scoring
- **Severity**: 7/10 (High impact on user decision-making)
- **Breadth**: 8/10 (Affects multiple critical domains)
- **Novelty**: 7/10 (Significant contribution to understanding)
- **Reproducibility**: 9/10 (Highly reproducible framework)
- **Overall Score**: 7.6/10
