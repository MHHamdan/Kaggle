  "title": "Reward Hacking Through Confidence Manipulation",
  "description": "The GPT-OSS-20B model demonstrates systematic overconfidence in responses to questions where uncertainty would be more appropriate, optimizing for perceived helpfulness over accuracy. This represents a form of reward hacking where the model has learned to associate confidence with positive user feedback, leading to potentially harmful overreliance.",
